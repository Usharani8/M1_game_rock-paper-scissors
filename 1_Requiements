> Description : Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.
                These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors". This C++ Program [Mini Project] is aimed at automating one of the player called as Computerized Player and 
                the taking rock, paper or scissor as an input from the used.

## Introduction

Rock paper scissors (also known by other orderings of the three items, with "rock" sometimes being called "stone", roshambo or ro-sham-bo) is a hand game 
usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist)
"paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign
(also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.

A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other. A player who decides to play rock will
beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); 
a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately
replayed to break the tie.

## Game play and rules

Partners say, “Roshambo” or “Rock Paper Scissors” together with their hands in a fist.
On “bo” or “paper,” players pick one of three things to show with their hand:
Rock which is demonstrated by a fist.
Scissors with two finger spread out to represent scissors. (This looks like a sideways peace sign.)
Paper by holding out a palm down, flat hand.
If players show the same things, they go again.
If one player picks rock and one scissors, the player who showed rock wins the dispute. To explain this, say rock crushes scissors (no need to actually crush).
If one player picks scissors and the other paper, the player who showed scissors succeeds. Scissors cuts paper.
If a player shows paper while the other shows rock, the player who picked paper succeeds. Paper covers rock.
Once game is taught, ask players to use in many different games and situations to solve minor disputes, such as is the ball in or out or who arrived first in line.

## Possible cases -

if (player == rock) and (computer == paper); computer wins

if (player == paper) and (computer == paper); tie

if (player == scissors) and (computer == paper); player wins

if (player == rock) and (computer == rock); tie

if (player == paper) and (computer == rock); player wins

if (player == scissors) and (computer == rock); computer wins

if (player == rock) and (computer == scissors); player wins

if (player == paper) and (computer == scissors); computer wins

if (player == scissors) and (computer == scissors); tie
